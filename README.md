# EduAR-Interactive-Learning-with-Augmented-Reality
A marker-based AR system where scanning textbook images triggers the display of virtual objects. This enhances learning with interactive visual aids. My role included designing AR interactions, integrating Vuforia SDK with Unity, and scripting in C# for object rendering and user interactions.
